## A simple Android app that reads basic battery information from Samsung devices:

- First Use Date  
- Battery Health  
- Charge Cycles  

This app was built entirely on my phone using GitHub Actions with the help of AI.

## Requirements

- A Samsung device that supports SysDump access by dialing *#9900#

## Installation

- Download the APK in [releases](https://github.com/dogpoopy/samsung-batterystats/releases)
